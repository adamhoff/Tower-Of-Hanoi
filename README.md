# Tower-Of-Hanoi

##Technologies Used:

  *HTML
  *CSS
  *Javascript
  *Drag and drop events

##Approaches Taken:

###Take 1:
  I used the first hour or so to stare at an empty editor, trying to figure out my game plan. Then once I figured out what I wanted to accomplish, I wrote it down in comments in the index.html, style.css and script.js files, deleting the comments as I went and accomplished what I needed to. For this take on my game, I used canvas to draw my discs and rods since I was confused on how to position divs correctly with CSS. I was almost completely finished until I figured out that canvas elements can't be access after they're created, so this direction wasn't going to work.

###Take 2:
  After a bunch of research on positioning elements and other functionality like how to drag and drop divs into different elements, I was 8 hours into my second day of the project and making a lot of progress. When day 3 came along, I was nearly finished with my game and managed to finish all the extra functionality and styling by mid-day.

##User stories:

  *As a user, I should be able to drag and drop a disc on to another rod so that I can successfully pay the game.
  *As a user, I should not be able to drag and drop a larger disc, on top of a smaller one because it is against the game's rules.
  *As a user, I should be able to select how many discs I want to play the game with so that I may challenge myself with more discs.
  *As a user, I should be able to reset the game in case I don't like my progress so far.
  *As a user, I should be able to see the minimum number of moves it takes to solve the puzzle so that I know how much time it will take me to solve.
